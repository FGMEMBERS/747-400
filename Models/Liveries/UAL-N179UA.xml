<!--United Airlines "Rising Blue" Livery by E-Savageair
 
 Background:

      In 2004 the Pentagram Group introduced the "Rising Blue" livery that seems to harken back to the original "Rainbow" livery, 
using a blue-tone cheatline on the windows and an over-cropped "tulip" on the tail.  The "Rising Blue" scheme however would have 
a short life: In 2011 United and Continental Airlines would merge and United would incorporate Continental's "Globe" design 
(that would replace Saul Bass's "Meatball" logo design) that would replace the Tulip.
